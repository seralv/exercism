# My Solutions to Exercism Python Exercises

Welcome to my repository! This contains my personal solutions to the exercises in the **Python** track on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises).

Exercism is a free, open-source platform for practicing programming with over 140 Python exercises, featuring automated code analysis and optional mentorship. I'm working through them progressively to improve my Python skills.

## Repository Structure

Each exercise typically has its own folder named in kebab-case (e.g., `hello-world`, `guidos-gorgeous-lasagna`, etc.). Inside each folder you'll find:

- The main file with my solution (usually `<exercise-name>.py`).
- The test files provided by Exercism (to verify the solution).
- Optionally, a README.md specific to the exercise with the problem description.

## Progress

- I'm completing the exercises in order, starting from the basics.
- This repository will be updated as I solve new exercises.

## How to Use This Repository

If you want to run the solutions:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to an exercise folder: `cd exercise-name`
3. Run the tests with `pytest` (make sure pytest is installed: `pip install pytest`)

**Note**: These are my personal solutions. I strongly recommend trying to solve the exercises yourself first on [Exercism](https://exercism.org) to get the most learning value. Avoid copying directly!
